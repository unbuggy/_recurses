# NAME
#   bake - makefile generator generator
#
# SYNOPSYS
#   bake
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   This script generates a make(1) file for the `src` directory.  The real
#   work is done by the find(1) utility -- which locates source files -- and
#   by the `mkmk` program that analyzes intra-project dependencies and prints
#   corresponding build rules.  Additionally, this script calls the `mklisting`
#   utility to generate a small amount of boilerplate C++ code.
#
# SEE ALSO
#   * doc/cpp-init.md for step-by-step usage instructions
#   * etc/mkmk.cpp for build configuration settings
#   * etc/mklisting for the boilerplate code generator

set -e  # Exit immediately on error.
